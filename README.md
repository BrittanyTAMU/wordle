**How It's Made:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The Wordle clone app is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are integrated into the JavaScript codebase to ensure modularity and reusability of components. Event listeners capture user input, and dynamic manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) updates the Wordle clone display. CSS is utilized to achieve visually appealing and responsive design across different devices.

**Lessons Learned:**
**User-Centric Approach**: Emphasizing array manipulation, debugging skills, project organization, and rigorous testing and feedback has underscored the importance of a user-centric design approach. Prioritizing these optimizations can enhance usability, accessibility, and overall satisfaction. Integrating features like SMS notifications or implementing disaster recovery methods to prevent loss of progress during gameplay are potential avenues for further improvement and refinement of the application.
